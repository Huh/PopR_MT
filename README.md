## PopR Issue Tracking

PopR code for MT FWP's website is housed in a private repository.

The purpose of this repository is to allow public commenting on issues and to allow for suggested enhancements.

### Reporting
If you think you have found a bug or wish to see a feature added to the website please place your comments at the following
[link](https://github.com/Huh/PopR_MT/issues).  No bug or comment is too small, feel free to tell us that we missed a comma in the text or you don't like the color blue.

#### Bugs
When you have a problem with the website please try to describe the set of conditions that created the error.  If we cannot reproduce the error there is less chance that we can fix the error.  The more thorough the explanation of what went wrong the better.  It is also a good idea to include information about your operating system (e.g. Windows 7), web browser (e.g. Chrome) and even versions of the above if known.

#### Enhancements
To make enhancement suggestions most useful please describe the current feature, if it exists, the problems with it and then the advantages of the new version you would like to see implemented.  The better you describe the enhancement the more likely we are to get it right.
